Concepts:
- Winternitz One-Time Signature (WOTS): creates a signature by iteratively applying hash functions in chains, with the length of these chains controlled by a parameter.
                                        the parameter balances between the signature’s size and the computational effort required

- Forest of Random Subsets (FORS): “few-time” signature scheme; splits a message (or its digest) into multiple parts and then signs each part with a small, independently generated one-time signature.
                                    These signatures are arranged in multiple small trees - a "forest" - and their combination provides an overall signature

Differences From the SPHINCS+ Submission
- Additional Address Types: FIPS 205 defines two new address types (WOTS_PRF and FORS_PRF) to improve secret key value generation in the WOTS+ and FORS components.

- Enhanced Key Inputs to Mitigate Attacks:  The standard now incorporates the public key seed (PK.seed) as an input to the pseudorandom function (PRF) and the
                                            mask generation function (MGF1) to help prevent multi‑key and multi‑target long‑message second preimage attacks.

- Stronger Hash Function Usage:  For higher security levels (categories 3 and 5), FIPS 205 replaces SHA‑256 with SHA‑512 in critical functions
                                (such as Hₘₛg, PRFₘₛg, H, and Tₗ) to address weaknesses identified in the original SPHINCS+ submission.

- Revised FORS Key Extraction: The method for extracting bits from the message digest for selecting a FORS key has been updated.
                               This change aligns the standard with the reference implementation, resolving previous ambiguities—even though it makes the new method incompatible with the older one.

- Pseudocode Corrections: Adjustments (such as correcting the shift of the checksum in wots_sign and wots_pkFromSig)
                          ensure that the pseudocode accurately reflects the intended operation of the algorithm.

- Domain Separation in SLH-DSA Functions: In response to public feedback on the initial FIPS 205 draft, the signing and verification functions
                                          were modified to explicitly separate cases where the message is signed directly versus signing its digest.
