From CRYSTALS‑Dilithium Version 3.1 to the ML‑DSA (FIPS 204) Initial Draft

- Further Changes in Bit-Lengths: ML‑DSA increases the length of 𝑡𝑟 (hash of public key) to 512 bits (in contrast to the reduction made in Version 3.1).
                                  The length of the variable (denoted as 𝑐̃, which is a polynomial used in the sign. gen.) is increased to 384 or 512 bits depending on the parameter set (ML‑DSA‑65 or ML‑DSA‑87).

- Modification of the Signing Algorithm:In the original CRYSTALS‑Dilithium submission, the signing algorithm is deterministic by default (with 𝜌′ -private random seed- derived from the private key and message),
                                        with an optional fully random variant.
                                        In ML‑DSA, however, 𝜌′ is generated by a “hedged” procedure: it is derived not only from the private key and the message but also from a 256‑bit random string produced by an
                                        Approved Random Bit Generator. An optional deterministic version is still allowed (where the random string is fixed to a constant).

- Pseudocode Correction:The draft ML‑DSA standard initially omitted a check for malformed input while unpacking a hint. Without this check, the signature scheme would not achieve strong existential unforgeability.
                        This omission is highlighted as a critical flaw that needed to be rectified.
